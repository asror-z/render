				<p>It had been my luck to live en famille with some <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">herder</a> Lapps once before in <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">North-Western Norway</a>. I had some elk shooting and some fishing up there, and I came across the tribe one <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">day poaching</a> red char from one of my own hired lakes.</p>

				<p>When we actually did get under weigh, our outfit consisted of one inferior <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">double-barrelled</a> 12-bore shot-gun by an anonymous maker, one good Marlin ’45 repeating <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">rifle</a> carrying a long bullet, a small assortment of tinned foods and loaded <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">cartridges</a>...</p>

				<p>It was these photographs which suggested going to see the Lapp in his own domains. The <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">map</a> showed the position of <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">Lapland</a> in large letters, and for the sake of definiteness we made up our minds to cross it from <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">north</a> to south...</p>
			</section>
			<section class="link-scaleup">
				<p>Drawing from our own ignorance, and from the united ignorance of <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">others</a> (most freely and generously bestowed), we mapped out the details of the <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">campaign</a> with glibness and ease. At <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">Vardö</a> we were to purchase furs to wear and horses to ride.</p>

				<p>It is not to be denied, though, that the Novaya Zemblya <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">scheme</a> had its seductions. There was in Vardö harbour a weird, clumsy craft of the type <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">locally</a> known as “yot,” which had <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">visited</a> that island many times with a crew of hunters. </p>
			</section>
			<section class="link-scaledown">
				<p>As regards the commissariat, that we decided would be simple also. Reindeer meat, <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">salmon</a>, rye bread, milk, cheese, and butter would be always procurable from the natives. And besides, we should <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">shoot</a> far <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">more game</a> than we could possibly use for the pot.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="link-flip">
				<p>The few tins of <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">provisions</a> we did take were mainly to serve as luxuries. For instance, we had quite a large <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">supply</a> of foie gras and larks in aspic.</p>
				<p>I had a vivid recollection of how the last tin of that <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">pâté de foie gras</a> went.</p>

				<p>With these hints, then, at our initial <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">ignorance</a> of what lay beyond, let me pass on to Vardö, which was the real starting-point of both our plans and our journey. The <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">Windward</a> made an easy <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">voyage</a> of it on the whole up to there, and although she carried away her main-topsail yard...</p>

				<p>Inside Vardö harbour walls, then, to a mooring we came, and the <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">smells</a> of the place closed round us and took possession. Bobbling about on the <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">harbour</a> swell around us were some two hundred vessels of strange <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">Northern</a> rig, and almost all connected with the trade in fish. </p>

				<p>In the <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">harbour</a>, steamers from France, and <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">Hamburg</a>, and lower Norway, load bales of the dried cod, which will carry the <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">aroma</a> of Vardö as far as Bremen, Brest, and St. Petersburg.</p>

				<p>Once the town was a strong place, but the star-shaped fort, which was built in 1735, is to-day obsolete, though <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_gun">field-guns</a> and some breech-loaders on slides still grin through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrasure">embrasures</a>, ...</p>

				<p>There are other towns of <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">Norway</a> given up to the cult of the cod, but nowhere is it so entirely the one staple of commerce as in this ancient <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">settlement</a> so far within the <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">Arctic Circle</a>. The tail of the Gulf Stream keeps its climate equable.</p>

				<p>But the <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">summer</a> is the time when <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">commerce</a> bristles. It is then that the larger merchants toil to make their wealth; and when the lamps begin to kindle in the windows, they take the mail <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">steamers</a> and go away to follow the retiring sun.</p>

				<p>Now <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">Vardö</a> was not what we had come so far to see, or smell. We wanted to get started on our travel in <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">Arctic Lapland</a> as quickly as might be; and as soon as the whale-boat had set us ashore amongst the <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/InlineAnchorStyles/#">fish litter</a> on one of the wharves, ...</p>
